## How it works

This project is an 8-bit Turbo-like encoder designed for Tiny Tapeout. It takes an 8-bit input (ui_in[7:0]) and, upon receiving a one-cycle pulse on the start signal (uio_in[0]), processes the input through two convolutional encoders. The first encoder operates directly on the input, while the second can optionally use an interleaved version (such as a bit-reversed form). Each encoder generates 4 parity bits using the generator polynomial G(D) = 1 + D + DÂ², and the final 8-bit output (uo_out[7:0]) is formed by concatenating these two 4-bit parity values. This structure offers a compact and hardware-efficient method for basic forward error correction.

## How to test

The design can be tested using either a Verilog testbench (tb.v) or a Cocotb testbench (test.py). For Verilog simulation, compile and run using a simulator like Icarus Verilog. The Cocotb test is recommended for functional testing, where a clock is started, reset is applied, and an 8-bit input value (e.g., 0b10101010) is loaded along with a one-cycle start pulse. The output (uo_out) is then verified against the expected encoded result (e.g., 0x99). You can run the Cocotb test using make -C test, and waveform analysis can be done by adding $dumpfile and viewing with GTKWave.
